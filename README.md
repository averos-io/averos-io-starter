# The NEW Averos Designer - WiBuild

Averos is now embracing LowCode / NoCode in order to streamline application development and get closer to citizenship development.

We have put in place a designer that is intented to help developers designing their requirements in a very intuitive way and then generate their applications based on their own design.

Creating web application could thus be achieved in three steps:
   #### **1- Design**
   #### **2- Generate**
   #### **3- Download & Run**

**averos designer** is available in the [WiBuild](https://appbuilder.wiforge.com) application which is powered by [**averos framework**](https://www.wiforge.com).

[**WiBuild**](https://appbuilder.wiforge.com) is available for both mobile and desktop devices, thus unlocking omnichannel no-code web application creation.

Please install [**WiBuild**](https://appbuilder.wiforge.com/) and enjoy no-code web application development using your mobile or your favorite browser.
